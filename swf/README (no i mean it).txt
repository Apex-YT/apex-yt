Hey there!

You must be looking at the source code of the offical ApexSummit Website.

This is where the swf files are located.

Using any of the swf files that we found, without permission is not acceptable.

PLEASE COPY AND PASTE THE CODE BELOW WHEN YOU USE OUR FILES!
===============================================================================================================================================
<body> We got this game from https://github.com/Apex-YT/apex-yt.github.io . The game is called PUT GAME NAME HERE by GAME DEVELOPER HERE</body>
===============================================================================================================================================

If you want to find the game developer, search this in your local search engine.

"GAME NAME HERE" "developer"
                  ^^^^^^^^^
                  in this spot, leave it as is.

Thanks,

The ApexSummit Dev Team
